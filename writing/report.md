#### What this is: Questions in blue from the assignment sheet.

#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

The software I used is the Freiburg RNa tools Needleman-Wunsch.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 These two sequences were very similar.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 I think it is safe to say that they are closely related to eachother based on the high score that they received when compared using the Needleman-Wunsch tool. 


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

The proof I have to suggest this claim is that when I used the tool to compare the sequences, it received a score of 29, meaning they are very similar.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

#TODO


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


#TODO

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
