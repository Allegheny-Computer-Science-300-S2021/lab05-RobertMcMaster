#### What this is: Questions in blue from the assignment sheet.

#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

The software I used is the Freiburg RNa tools Needleman-Wunsch.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 These two sequences were very similar.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 I think it is safe to say that they are closely related to eachother based on the high score that they received when compared using the Needleman-Wunsch tool. 


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

The proof I have to suggest this claim is that when I used the tool to compare the sequences, it received a score of 29, meaning they are very similar.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

The sequences that were the most related were sequences B and C, while the sequences that were least related were sequences A and C.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

Based on it's similarity to other viruses, I believe that there is a high chance that human adaptation of the H5N1 virus while occur in the near future which should merit some level of concern.

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?

A = Influenz A 2005
B = Influenza A 2006
C = Influenza 2007

A and B 
Length: 1776
Similarity: 1690/1776 (95.2%)
Gaps: 45/1776 (2.5%)
score: 8286

B and C 
Length: 1776
Similarity: 1731/1776 (97.5%)
Gaps: 25/1776 (1.4%)
score: 9703

A and C
Length: 1750
Similarity: 1681/1750 (96.1%)
Gaps: 19/1750 (1.1%)
score: 9379
